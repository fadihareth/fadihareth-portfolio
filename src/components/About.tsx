            <p>
                I'm a software developer with a passion for building intuitive, elegant experiences â€” not just
                in how users interact with an app, but also in how the codebase is structured underneath the hood.
                I've worked across both mobile and web platforms, and enjoy the unique challenges and creative
                opportunities each one brings. At its core, software development is simply something I love and
                always have fun doing. Whether it's bringing ideas to life and solving problems through thoughtful
                design and clean architecture or blending it with personal hobbies to create something personal,
                I always take pride in my work and strive to keep improving.
