                I'm a software developer with a passion for building intuitive, elegant experiences â€” not just
                in how users interact with an app, but also in how the codebase is structured underneath the hood.
                I've worked across both mobile and web platforms, and enjoy the unique challenges and creativity
                each one brings. Whether it's bringing ideas to life and solving problems through thoughtful design
                or blending it with personal hobbies to create something personal, software development is something
                I always enjoy and strive to continue improving at.
